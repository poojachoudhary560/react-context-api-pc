- applying react context requires 3 actors: 
-- the context
-- the provider extracted from context
-- the consumer

- when the context value is changed by altering the prop of the context provider, then all of its consumers are notified and re-rendered.

- Updating the context
The React Context API is stateless by default and  does not provide a dedicated method to update the context value from consumer components.

But this can be easily implemented by integrating a state management mechanism like useState or useReducer hooks and providing an update function right in the context next to value itself.
